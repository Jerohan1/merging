## Merging

- Assume you have two sorted lists, `x` and `y`, and you want to combine them into a new sequence, `z`, that contains all the elements from `x` and all the elements from `y`, in sorted order. You can create `z` by *merging* `x` and `y` as follows: have an index, `i`, into `x` and another index, `j`, into `y`—both initially zero—and compare `x[i]` with `y[j]`. If `x[i] < y[j]`, then append `x[i]` to `z` and increment `i` by one. Otherwise, append `y[j]` to `z` and increment `j`. If either `i` reaches the length of `x` or `j` reaches the end of `y`, simply copy the remainder of the other list to `z`.

The list is correct because of the two input list are already correctly sorted which means that `list[i-1] < list[i]`. So if you always take the smallest number from each list and go through all of the two list and popping the value to the new list, it will create a correctly sorted list as you essentially always look at the first element of each list seperately and pop the value to the new sorted list. The program terminates when both of the input list are empty lists.
